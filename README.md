# FanDuel MLB Roster Generator
Fantasy baseball is a contest in which entrants create a team lineup from the list of players who are playing in one of the MLB games on that day.  Each player has a 'salary' - an associated cost - and entrants must choose their team while spending at or below $35,000.  After the MLB games have concluded, each player is assigned a number of fantasy points based on their performance during the game.  The entrant whose fantasy team has the highest fantasy point total wins.  

This program suggests a roster of players likely to score well for a given day.  Users will download the players list for the day from FanDuel and upload it to the program.  The players list contains the list of players for the day, as well as their FanDuel-assigned salaries.  The program will then use historical data to suggest a player lineup that is likely to score well.
